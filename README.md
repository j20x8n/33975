ASSESSMENT DETAILS Widening Accounting Horizons A (08 33975) Assignment 2: Individual 1,000 word Business Report Attendance and participation in lectures and seminars is vital for your success in this module because if you do not attend then you will not have company transactions to include and discuss in your report
The Business report relates to the second half of the module (focusing on SAASU and business processes). There is a required format for the presentation of this report: a word document with “cropped screengrabs” of the relevant sections of your Saasu ERP software. It should demonstrate well-organised presentation and coherent writing.
Detail: Saasu numbers plus explanatory narrative 
During your lectures you will receive guidance and tuition on how a company accounts for transactions. You will also have practical experience of ‘posting’ those transactions in your own virtual company that you set up in Saasu.
NB DO NOT WORRY ABOUT PERFECTION - your transactions do not have to be 100% accurate – just close enough to prove that you understand what you are doing. 
This aligns to many businesses where Financial statements are not accurate to the penny, but portray a ‘materially’ correct representation of the businesses financial position (Some of you will explore this in more detail next year if you select the AUDIT module)
Your transactions should mirror those that I ask you to make, and not include any others – There is a risk that if you post random or wrong transactions that you lose some marks in the “numbers” section of the assignment below. 
If you do accidentally create the wrong transactions, you can delete them, but this can be quite complicated depending on how much other work you have done.
Follow the guidance in the interactive lectures, and if needed spend time afterwards, ensuring your Saasu transactions are a close as possible to what has been requested.
You do not have to be perfect with your work; this is a new area and will be challenging for some of you (especially if you miss lectures or don’t代 写33975 Widening Accounting Horizons ASQL

The detail (wordcount 1,000 words – not including screenshots):  
This report should include the following: 1.   Screenshots of the following screens:o   Dashboard at year end*o   Trial balance at year endo   Inventory (also known as Stock) at year endo   Accounts Payable (or Trade Creditors) at the year endo   Accounts Receivable (or trade Debtors) at the year end2.   Narrative relating to the following screenshots1.   Trial balance at year end – Description and identification of any key / unusual balances not already discussed in 2, 3 or 4 below2.   Inventory at year end by quantity and value – Describe the type of inventory that exists in the business and whether management need to action anything / any other points that you think are relevant3.   Accounts Payable at the year end – Describe what AP relates to and why management do not want this to be too small. Also any other points that you think are relevant4.   Accounts Receivable at the year end – Describe what AR relates to and why management want this figure to be small. Also any other points that you think are relevant3.   Good professional appearance: Think about how you want to structure the above to make it look like a professional piece of work. (eg Headings / Titles / etc)
* NB Year end for the purpose of this assignment occurs immediately after the final hands on Saasu session that you do – ie your Saasu final position with your software. It does not relate to any of my add-on sessions – these will occur outside Saasu.
